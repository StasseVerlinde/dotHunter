# Computer vision - catch the dot

Welcome to this assessment on finger/hand detection using computer vision. This assessment is divided into two parts. In the first part, you will use your own camera to catch a dot with your index finger. In the second part, you will work with an image of a hand and determine whether the hand is touching a randomly generated dot or not. You don't need to build a custom model from scratch, as MediaPipe already provides functionalities to detect your fingers, their coordinates and hand-knuckles.

## Streaming your hand

Your task is to play a game using your camera to catch a dot with only your index finger. The game consists of the following steps:

- A dot of a certain size will be visualized on the screen at a random position.
- You need to touch the dot with your index finger.
- Once you touch the dot with your index finger, the dot disappears from the screen.
- The dot will then reappear at another random position on the screen.
- You need to reach out and touch the dot again with your index finger.
- You can only touch the dot with your index finger, and not any other part of your hand.

*Bonus*: make it more fun and count the times you catch the dot.

## Extended version

With two is always more fun than alone! Add a second gamer hand to the game. Touch the dot as fast as possible. Count the score of each player that is visible on the screen.

## Expectations

We expect you to carefully consider the following topics throughout the assessment:

- Properly managing the required packages
